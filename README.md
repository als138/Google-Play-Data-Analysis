- **app.py** — Backend web application; likely handles HTTP requests and serves the frontend with FastAPI.
- **main.py** —  contains the core logic for data processing or orchestration.
- **pre.ipynb** — A Jupyter notebook for preliminary data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **importToTabels.ipynb** — used for importing processed data into databases or tables posgresql DataBase.

##  ℹ About

**Google Play Data Analysis** is a web-based tool designed to help data enthusiasts and developers analyze mobile app performance on the Google Play Store. It focuses on utilizing advanced database strategies to provide actionable insights.

---

##  Features (Proposed)

- **Data Ingestion**: Load data from various sources, such as CSV, JSON exports, or APIs.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Conduct in-depth preprocessing using `pre.ipynb`.
- **Database Integration**: Efficiently store and manage data using SQL or NoSQL backends—likely referenced in `importToTabels.ipynb`.
- **Interactive Analysis**: Provide query-based or visual exploration through `app.py` and `main.py`.
- **Export & Reporting**: Enable export of results in common formats (CSV, JSON) or visualization dashboards.

---

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- Jupyter Notebook (for `.ipynb` files)  
- Required Python libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `flask`, `sqlalchemy`) — install via:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  > *Note*: If `requirements.txt` does not exist, manually install needed packages as specified in code or notebooks.

### Setup & Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/als138/Google-Play-Data-Analysis.git
   cd Google-Play-Data-Analysis
   ```

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Open and run `pre.ipynb` in Jupyter to clean and prepare raw data.

3. **Data Import**: Use `importToTabels.ipynb` to load preprocessed data into your database or tabular store.

4. **Launch the Web App**:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```  
   By default, it may run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`—check the console for details.

5. **Explore the App**: Navigate to the running URL to explore visualizations, filters, and insights.

##  Directory Overview

| File / Folder                | Purpose |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| `app.py`                    | Web application entry point (frontend + backend) |
| `main.py`                   | Contains analytic logic or orchestrates modules |
| `pre.ipynb`                 | Jupyter notebook for raw data preprocessing |
| `importToTabels.ipynb`      | Notebook to import clean data into tables/databases |
| `.gitattributes`            | Git configuration for file handling |
| `__pycache__/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/` | Auto-generated runtime artifacts — suitable for exclusion |

---

##  Recommendations & Next Steps

- **Add `requirements.txt`** — List all Python dependencies for easier setup.
- **Include sample data or data ingestion instructions** — Improve onboarding.
- **Add usage examples or screenshots** — Show insight dashboards or query results.
- **Write tests** — Ensure data loading, analysis functions, and web endpoints are validated.
- **Provide deployment guide** — Deploy with Docker, Heroku, or similar platforms for reproducibility.
